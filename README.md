Demonstration of Synaptic Behavior in a Heavy-Metal- Ferromagnetic-Metal-OxideHeterostructure-Based Spintronic Device for On-Chip Learning in Crossbar-Array-Based Neural Networks.

Nanomagnetic and spintronic devices use PMA (perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy) and SOT
(Spin Orbit Torque) which offers electrically readable and controllable states. In ANN these are
synaptic elements. The research paper demonstrates spintronic devices based on heavy-metalferromagnetic-metal- oxide-heterostructure incorporating elements like Pt, Co, SiO2, which utilize
multiple mixed states for experimental purposes. This mixed state corresponds to saturated states
which are placed between different magnetization configurations, where all magnetic moments are
oriented vertically up or vertically down (the ferromagnetic layer exhibits PMA). LTP (Long Term
Potentiation) and LTD (Long Term Depression) are demonstrated within this device when the
mixed states are modulated through in-plane-current pulses. The LTP and LTD behavior are
qualitatively observed through micromagnetic simulations. The stability of the mixed state is
experimentally determined to be 5 with the synaptic bit resolution. ANN is a crossbar array which
stimulates synaptic models based on the derived LTP and LTD behavior. Also, high classification
accuracy is given by MNIST and Fashion- MNIST.
